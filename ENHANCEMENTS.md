# Future Enhancements

1. Weight progression guidance / strength training with heavier, shorter sets
2. Exercise illustrations (Da Vinci style) — SVG code exists but is hidden via CSS
3. Links to external exercise videos
4. User-suggested exercises for the database
5. Better spacing/positioning for the remove (red X) button in workout item rows
6. Workout quality scoring — measure muscle balance (push/pull ratio, anterior/posterior coverage), flag gaps, grade overall workout quality with suggestions to improve
7. Insights: Show muscle imbalances — flag if certain muscle groups are consistently underworked across logged workouts
8. Manual Build — sort option for exercise list (alphabetical, by category, by difficulty)
9. Manual Build — highlight favorite/saved exercises in the exercise picker
10. Manual Build — auto-sort exercises by equipment type (KB vs. mat/bodyweight)
11. Nested kettlebell SVG in Settings — refine the kettlebell silhouette shape and improve tap targets for easier interaction on mobile
12. Workout of the Week — curated/featured workout that rotates weekly
13. Revamp muscle activation diagrams — replace current geometric body SVGs with more anatomically detailed/realistic figures (see mockups/ screenshot for reference). Likely needs illustration software or a proper SVG body template rather than hand-coded paths
