# Future Enhancements

1. Weight progression guidance / strength training with heavier, shorter sets
2. Exercise illustrations during workout timer — 11 stick-figure SVGs saved in `illustrations/` subfolder (swing, goblet, press, row, turkish, plank, deadlift, lunge, farmer, curl, glute bridge). Needs refinement before integrating into timer display. Props include orange mat/bench.
3. Links to external exercise videos
4. User-suggested exercises for the database
5. Better spacing/positioning for the remove (red X) button in workout item rows — tried absolute top-right but felt off, reverted to inline. Needs a better approach.
6. Workout quality scoring — measure muscle balance (push/pull ratio, anterior/posterior coverage), flag gaps, grade overall workout quality with suggestions to improve
7. Insights: Show muscle imbalances — flag if certain muscle groups are consistently underworked across logged workouts
8. ~~Manual Build — sort option for exercise list (alphabetical, by category, by difficulty)~~ DONE — sort dropdown added
9. Manual Build — highlight favorite/saved exercises in the exercise picker
10. ~~Manual Build — auto-sort exercises by equipment type (KB vs. mat/bodyweight)~~ DONE — included in sort dropdown as "Sort: Equipment"
11. Nested kettlebell SVG in Settings — refine the kettlebell silhouette shape and improve tap targets for easier interaction on mobile
12. Workout of the Week — curated/featured workout that rotates weekly
13. Revamp muscle activation diagrams — replace current geometric body SVGs with more anatomically detailed/realistic figures (see mockups/ screenshot for reference). Likely needs illustration software or a proper SVG body template rather than hand-coded paths
14. Settings — equipment inventory: add slam ball / medicine ball toggle alongside kettlebell weights, unlocking slam ball and med ball exercises in the exercise database
15. Affiliate links for recommended equipment (kettlebells, slam balls, mats, etc.)
